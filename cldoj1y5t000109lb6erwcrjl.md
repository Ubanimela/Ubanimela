**Technical writing** is a unique communication method involving documentation for products and services.

Technical writers help people understand how to use products correctly by putting detailed information in a way that is easy to understand.

Technical writing also deals with science, engineering, and technology.

In contrast, a good technical writer makes a difficult task easy and can quickly explain complex information.

So basically, having the ability to explain complex information, documentation, products, and services makes you a good technical writer.

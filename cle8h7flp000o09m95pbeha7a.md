# Best Approaches and Techniques for Successful Debugging: My Experience  Why Debugging is an Important Skill

Hey guys, I'm joining the [**#DebuggingFeb**](https://hashnode.com/n/debuggingfeb) Writeathon, to write about my experience with debugging lots of codes.

When I started learning as a frontend dev, I experienced a lot of difficulties debugging my code to the extent I felt tired of the process.

Not just front-end developers, back-end developers, or full-stack developers, every developer has encountered challenges.

In this article, we'll explore some of the best approaches and techniques for successful debugging and why debugging is an essential skill for software engineers.

Below are the contents you're going to understand in this article about my journey with debugging.

Debugging is a critical process in software development that involves identifying and fixing errors, bugs, or other issues in software code. Successful debugging can be the difference between a smooth-running application or a program that crashes frequently, resulting in lost time, effort, and potentially significant financial losses.

Debugging is the process of finding and resolving bugs, errors, or other issues that impact software performance. The process typically involves a variety of steps, including identifying the issue, reproducing the error, and fixing the problem.

One of the most common ways to identify a bug is through testing.

Testing allows developers to assess the software under different conditions, which can help to identify and isolate potential issues. However, identifying a problem is just the first step. Debugging is the process of finding the root cause of the issue and fixing it.

Debugging is a crucial part of software development, and it requires a unique set of skills and techniques. These skills include the ability to read and understand code, identify patterns, and recognize common errors.

A successful software engineer must be proficient in debugging, as it is an integral part of software development.

### Debugging Techniques: Tips for Effective Debugging

There are many different approaches to debugging, and the best technique will depend on the specific problem being addressed. Below are some of the most effective debugging techniques that can be used to resolve issues in software code:

**1\. USE A DEBUGGER**

Debuggers are powerful tools that allow developers to pause code execution and examine the current state of the program. They enable developers to step through the code line by line, examine variables, and set breakpoints to halt execution at specific points. By using a debugger, developers can quickly identify and resolve issues in code.

**2\. REPRODUCE THE ERROR**

Reproducing the error is an essential step in debugging. It involves understanding the steps that led to the error and replicating them. This helps developers to isolate the problem and understand the specific circumstances that led to the issue. Once the error is reproducible, developers can use a debugger to step through the code and find the root cause of the issue.

**3\. USE PRINT STATEMENT**

Print statements can be a useful debugging tool. By adding print statements to code, developers can output the value of variables or other data at specific points in the code. This can help to identify where the error occurred and what values are causing the problem.

**4\. DIVIDE AND CONQUER**

Divide and conquer is a technique that involves breaking down code into smaller, more manageable pieces. By dividing code into smaller chunks, developers can isolate the problem and identify the root cause of the issue. This can make it easier to debug complex code and reduce the time required to find and fix the error.

**5\. REVIEW THE CODE**

Reviewing the code can be an effective way to identify errors or issues. Code reviews can be performed by the developer or by a peer. Reviewing code can help to identify patterns or issues that may have been missed during initial testing.

### Best Practices for Successful Debugging

Debugging can be a challenging process, and it requires a specific set of skills and techniques. However, there are some best practices that developers can follow to make the process more effective:

**1\. Start with simple tests**

When testing software, it is best to start with simple tests and work your way up to more complex ones. This helps to isolate potential issues and makes it easier to identify the root cause of the problem.

**2\. Use version control**

Version control is an essential tool for software development. It enables developers to track changes to code over time, making it easier to identify when a problem was introduced.

### My Experience with debugging codes

While working as a front-end dev intern at Aptech on an important web-based application for my project manager.

I have been working on it for months, and it was nearing completion. The project involved developing a web-based application that allowed users to search for and book rides online like Uber and Bolt.

I received an urgent call from my project manager one day, informing me that the website was not working properly and that customers were unable to complete their bookings. I quickly began investigating the problem.

I started by reviewing the website's code and discovered that the search function was not functioning properly, but before I discovered the errors I saw hell while debugging.

There are times while debugging you even feel like smashing your gadget ðŸ˜‘

After debugging the errors I deployed the fix, and the application was back up and running correctly.

My project manager was impressed by my dedication and problem-solving skills, and the website continued to operate successfully.

In the end, I learned that sometimes the solution to a complex problem can be found in unexpected places. By being patient, thorough, and determined, I was able to identify the root cause of the issue and create a workaround that allowed the application to continue running until a more permanent fix could be implemented.

### **Conclusion**

***Remember as a software engineer,***

***A complex problem can be found in unexpected places. By being patient, thorough, and determined, you will be able to identify the root cause of the issue and create a workaround.***

I'm participating in the #DebuggingFeb [Writeathon](https://townhall.hashnode.com/debugging-feb-writeathon) to share my expertise in debugging numerous programs.

I had a lot of [trouble](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01988e349515b99aa9?viewMode=1) debugging my code when I started as a front-end developer, so I got weary of it.

Every developer has faced difficulties, not just front-end developers, back-end developers, or full-stack developers.

This article will talk about some of the best methods and techniques for debugging, as well as how important debugging is for software engineers.

Here is information regarding my debugging experience that you will read about in this article.

### Debugging:Â What is it?

In software development, finding and fixing errors, bugs, and other problems in the code is a key part of the debugging process.

Effective debugging can make the difference between an application that runs smoothly and one that crashes often, which can cost time, effort, and possibly a lot of money.

Debugging identifies and resolves errors, defects, and other program performance issues.

The process often has more than one step, such as finding the problem, confirming it, and fixing it.

Testing is one of the techniques used for finding problems.

Testing lets programmers see how the software works in different situations, which can help them find and isolate any problems.

Nevertheless, recognizing a problem is only the first step.

Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing the problem's root cause.

Debugging is an important part of making software; it requires unique skills and steps.

These skills include spotting patterns, understanding computer code, and spotting common mistakes.

Debugging is a crucial component of software development. Hence, a software engineer needs to be skilled in this area.

### Strategies for Successful Debugging

Debugging can be done in various ways, and the most effective method will depend on the particular issue at hand.

Here are some of the best methods for finding and fixing bugs in software code:

**1\. BE SURE TO DEBUG**

Developers can interrupt code execution and check the program's state using powerful tools known as debuggers.

These tools allow you to step through the code line by line, look at variables, and set breakpoints to stop the program's execution at particular points.

A debugger helps developers quickly identify and resolve code issues.

**2\. REPEAT THE ERROR**

Debugging requires you to replicate the error. Recreating the error requires knowing the steps that led to it.

It aids developers in locating the issue and comprehending the particular circumstances that gave rise to it.

Once the error can be repeated, developers can use a debugger to review the code and find out why it happened.

**3\. USING PRINT STATEMENT**

Using print statements as a debugging tool can be helpful. By adding print statements, for example, developers can show the value of variables or other data at certain points in the code.

It can assist in locating the error's source and the problematic values.

**4\. DIVVY UP AND TAKE OVER**

A strategy entails breaking complicated code into simpler, more manageable chunks.

By breaking up large code into smaller pieces, developers can find problems and determine what caused them.

This can speed up finding and fixing errors in complex code and make debugging more straightforward.

**5\. REVIEW THE CODE**

Reviewing the code can be an effective way to identify errors or issues. A peer or the developer can perform code reviews.

Reviewing code can help identify patterns or issues that may have been missed during initial testing.

### Guidelines for Effective Debugging

Debugging can be a challenging process that requires a specific set of skills and techniques.

However, there are some best practices that developers can follow to make the process more effective:

**1\. Start with simple tests**

When testing software, it is best to start with simple tests and work up to more complex ones.

This helps to find possible problems and makes it easier to figure out what's causing them.

**2\. Use version control**

Version control is an essential tool for software development.

It lets developers see how code has changed over time, which makes it easier to figure out when a problem started.

### My knowledge of coding and debugging

As a [front-end developer](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01988e349515b99aa9?viewMode=1) intern at Aptech, I worked on a crucial online application for my project manager.

I had been working on it for weeks and was almost finished.

The project involved creating a web-based application that lets users book rides online.

One day, my project manager sent me a frantic call to tell me that the website was having technical difficulties and that clients could not complete their bookings.

Immediately, I started looking into it right away.

I began by looking at the website's source code and found that the search function wasn't working properly, but before I found the flaws, I went through hell when debugging.

There are moments when troubleshooting your device makes you want to crush it.

After figuring out what was wrong, I installed the update, and the app returned to working as it should.

My commitment and problem-solving abilities won the respect of my project manager, and the website kept running smoothly.

Ultimately, I learned that sometimes the answer to a hard problem could be found in a place you wouldn't expect.

I found the main cause of the problem and made a workaround so that the application could keep running normally until a more permanent fix could be made.

I was persistent, thorough, and patient.

### `Conclusion`

***As a*** [***software engineer***](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01988e349515b99aa9?viewMode=1)***, keep in mind the following:***

***Unexpected locales can contain difficult issues.***

***But if you are thorough, persistent, and patient, you can determine where the problem is coming from and how to fix it.***

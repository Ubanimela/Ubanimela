# Best Approaches and Methods for Effective Debugging: My Experience Why Debugging Is a Crucial Skill

I'm participating in the #DebuggingFeb [Writeathon](https://townhall.hashnode.com/debugging-feb-writeathon) to share my expertise in debugging numerous programs.

I had a lot of trouble debugging my code when I started as a front-end developer, so I got weary of it.

Every developer has faced difficulties, not just front-end developers, back-end developers, or full-stack developers.

This article will discuss some of the most effective debugging methods and techniques and the importance of debugging to software engineers.

Here is information regarding my debugging experience that you will read about in this article.

### Debugging: What is it?

In software development, finding and fixing errors, bugs, and other problems in the code is a key part of the debugging process.

Effective debugging can make the difference between an application that runs without hiccups and one that frequently crashes, costing time, effort, and possibly considerable financial losses.

Debugging identifies and resolves errors, defects, and other program performance issues.

The process often has more than one step, such as finding the problem, confirming it, and fixing it.

Testing is one of the techniques used for finding problems.

Testing lets programmers see how the software works in different situations, which can help them find and isolate any problems.

Nevertheless, recognizing a problem is only the first step.

Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing the problem's root cause.

Debugging is an important part of making software, but it requires unique skills and steps.

Some of these skills are the ability to spot patterns, understand computer code, and spot common mistakes.

Debugging is a crucial component of software development. Hence, a software engineer needs to be skilled in this area.

### Strategies for Successful Debugging

Debugging can be done in various ways, and the most effective method will depend on the particular issue at hand.

Some of the best debugging methods for resolving problems in software code are listed below:

**1\. BE SURE TO DEBUG**

Developers can interrupt code execution and check the program's state using strong tools known as debuggers.

These tools allow you to step through the code line by line, look at variables, and set breakpoints to stop the program's execution at particular points.

A debugger helps developers quickly identify and resolve code issues.

**2\. REPEAT THE ERROR**

Debugging requires you to replicate the error. Recreating the error requires knowing the steps that led to it.

It aids developers in locating the issue and comprehending the particular circumstances that gave rise to it.

Developers can use a debugger to step through the code and identify the reason for the error once it is reproducible.

**3\. USING PRINT STATEMENT**

Using print statements as a debugging tool can be helpful. For example, developers can output the value of variables or other data at precise locations in the code by adding print statements.

It can assist in locating the error's source and the problematic values.

**4\. DIVVY UP AND TAKE OVER**

A strategy entails breaking complicated code into simpler, more manageable chunks.

Developers can isolate problems and pinpoint the underlying causes of problems by breaking up large pieces of code into smaller pieces.

This can speed up the process of finding and fixing errors in complex code and make debugging more straightforward.

**5\. REVIEW THE CODE**

Reviewing the code can be an effective way to identify errors or issues. Code reviews can be performed by the developer or by a peer.

Reviewing code can help to identify patterns or issues that may have been missed during initial testing.

### Guidelines for Effective Debugging

Debugging can be a challenging process, and it requires a specific set of skills and techniques.

However, there are some best practices that developers can follow to make the process more effective:

**1\. Start with simple tests**

When testing software, it is best to start with simple tests and work your way up to more complex ones.

This helps to isolate potential issues and makes it easier to identify the root cause of the problem.

**2\. Use version control**

Version control is an essential tool for software development.

It enables developers to track changes to code over time, making it easier to identify when a problem was introduced.

### My knowledge of coding and debugging

As a front-end developer intern at Aptech, I worked on a crucial online application for my project manager.

I had been working on it for weeks and almost finished.

The project involved creating a web-based application that lets users book rides online.

One day, my project manager sent me a frantic call to tell me that the website was having technical difficulties and that clients could not complete their bookings.

Immediately, I started looking into it right away.

I began by looking at the website's source code and found that the search function wasn't working properly, but before I found the flaws, I went through hell when debugging.

There are moments when troubleshooting your device makes you even want to crush it.

I applied the update after troubleshooting the problems, and the application resumed functioning as intended.

My commitment and problem-solving abilities won the respect of my project manager, and the website kept running smoothly.

In the end, I discovered that a complex problem's solution could occasionally be discovered in unexpected locations.

I pinpointed the problem's primary source and provided a workaround that allowed the application to function normally until a more substantial fix could be implemented.

I was persistent, thorough, and patient.

***As a software engineer, keep in mind the following:***

***Unexpected locales can contain difficult issues.***

***However, you can find the source of the problem and come up with a solution by being thorough, persistent, and patient.***
